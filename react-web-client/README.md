## ReactJS Client Web Application for Micro Service Me Up Project.

### Requirements 

First need to install NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/

Setting up React base
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app-name
```

Downloading dependency libraries
```
npm install react-router –save
npm install react-router-dom –save
npm install bootstrap –save
npm install jquery –save
npm install popper.js –save
npm install reactstrap –save	
```
Run application
`npm start`


### Current Situation

Unfinished. In a state of a prototype. Further development did not fit further sprints
and could cause loss of time for more important requirements of the project.

Requires more time to learn about handling OAuth2 authentication in Node environment.
Requires refactoring of code and implementing better design to suit modern way of 
developing ReactJS application. 

Recommend to clearly separate presentation components, smart components and add 
container components in combination with Redux library for local storage.
